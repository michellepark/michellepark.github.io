    <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

    <p>Ah, yes. You've most likely heard of those two words before. Or worse, experienced it. If you are one of the few who haven't though, allow me to explain.</p>

    <p>Stereotype threat is the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype. Basically, subconscious self-handicapping. For example, African-American students fare worse on standardized tests than White students. Why? Because they have been made to feel inferior their whole lives, thus perpetuating their notion that they are not good enough, which makes them perform badly.</p>

    <p>In terms of race, I feel that being an Asian-American actually <em><strong>helped</strong></em> me rather than hurt me. This is the opposite of stereotype threat - stereotype boost - where people fare better because of positive stereotypes about their group. Asians are stereotyped as being good academically and performing well on standardized tests. You always hear of those jokes where Asian parents don't accept anything less than an A+ (my own dad once offered to get my sister a private tutor when her <em><strong>PROGRESS REPORT</strong></em> said she was getting a B+ in physics. True story.) or where the only acceptable profession is being a doctor or a lawyer. Amirite? Because of that pressure, we tend to fare well in school and be successful. I know I always got good grades and school always came first.</p>

    <p>But stereotype threat isn't only related to race. It's connected to gender as well. And this is where I'm affected the most.</p>

    <p>I've talked about this a little in my "<a href="http://michellepark.github.io/blog/c4-tech-issues.html">Issues in Tech</a>" blog post, but women are definitely seen as substandard to men, even to this day, especially in the tech world. You hear the word "programmer" and most people are (hopefully pleasantly) surprised if it's a girl. People think dudes are better at programmers for whatever reason, and us ladies should be wearing aprons or whatever. Please.</p>

    <p>I admit, sometimes I feel like I'm not expected to perform as well in this vocation (not to mention many other ones...let me tell you a little story here. One time I was making small talk at a bus stop and told this older man how I wanted to be a pilot. His response? That I should be a flight attendant instead because I would crash the plane. WOW SEROIUSLY? First of all, go F**K yourself, and secondly, if this doesn't also anger you, then there's another problem on our hands.) because I AM a girl. It's disheartening, and I worry that I might be looked down upon because of my gender.</p>

    <p>In times like these, I just remind myself how much satisfaction I would get by proving everyone wrong, and it just motivates me harder. I feel lucky in that sense; instead of letting it bring me down, I use it to help me make me better and stronger. I guess I've develeoped a thicker skin over the years.</p>

    <p id="footer">However, I know that not everyone can deal with such negative emotions in a positive way. I feel that the best way to help someone dealing with this is to remind them that it's all in their heads and what we think we can achieve greatly correlates to what we actually do achieve. Sure, it's not always easy, but the culture of DBC is one that seems to not allow this kind of negativity. We have to speak up for ourselves and make sure this doesn't happen to us. I regret not telling off old douchy bus stop dude, so I know not to make that mistake again. With all the wonderful, thoughtful, kind-hearted, intelligent people we're going to be surrounded with, we can make a lasting impact and make steretype threat crash and burn (pun intended).</p>
