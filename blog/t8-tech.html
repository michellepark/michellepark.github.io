    <h1>Ruby on Rails</h1>

    <p>We've been studying Ruby for many weeks now. But we always hear of Ruby on Rails. What is this "rails" part that they keep talking about, and is it important?</p>

    <p>If Ruby is the programming language, Rails is the software library that extends that language. It is software code that is added to the Ruby programming language, or more technically, it is a package library (specifically, a RubyGem) that is installed using the operating system command-line interface.

    <p>Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server, and is a framework for building websites. It is designed to make programming web apps easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started and allowing them to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks.</p>

    <p>There are two major guiding principles to Rails: <br>br>

      <ul>
        <li><b>DRY</b>: don't repeat yourself (this is the standard in every programming language though).</li>
        <li><b>Convention over Configuration</b>: Rails defaults to a set of its own conventional way to do things.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Because of this, Rails is extremely productive, and it simplifies the task of building complex websites.</p>

    <h2>Why Rails?</h2>

    <p>From a web browser's perspective, Rails dynamically generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. From a coder's perspective, Rails has a set of files organized in a specific way that can easily be editable and thus allow other Rails developers to collaborate. From a gem hunter's perspective, Rails has so many gems (software libraries) that provide useful features for building websites. And from a tester's perspective, Rails is committed to TDD (test driven development), which is a core value to improving user experience and finding problems before the product is released.</p>
