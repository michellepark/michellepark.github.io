      <h2>CSS - Absolute, Relative, and Fixed Positioning. Say whaa?</h2>


    I don’t know about you, but I often times get confused by these words and how to use them. Hopefully this guide can help you better understand these terms.

    Let’s start off with relative positioning. Essentially, that just means being able to take an element and move it from the natural flow of the page <em><strong>without affecting the rest of the elements on the page</strong></em>. For example, take a look at this page:

    ![original](../css-blog-imgs/original.png)

    Now if you make the paragraph have relative positioning

    ![rel code](../css-blog-imgs/rel-pos-code.png)

    this is what happens:

    ![rel pos para](../css-blog-imgs/rel-pos-paragraph.png)

    See, it moved the paragraph down without moving the header or the picture.

    Absolute positioning, on the other hand, is aligning an element in relation to its parent element, which is usually the html document itself. For example, if you set the image to have absolute positioning:

    ![abs top left](../css-blog-imgs/abs-pos-top-left.png)

    The picture is 0px from the bottom and right of the whole page, because the absolute positioning is in relation to the whole document. If however, say you wanted to move the picture somewhere in the middle of the page. Then you have to make sure the parent element has position relative.

    ![abs code](../css-blog-imgs/abs-pos-code.png)

    ![abs right](../css-blog-imgs/abs-pos-dog-right.png)

    Now you can see that the image is 0px from the right and bottom from the container element, because the container was set to have position relative.

    Fixed positioning might be the most straightforward and easiest to understand. It basically means an element is fixed in relation to the browser window. For example, have you ever seen a website where you scroll down but the navigation bar “follows” you? Yup, that’s fixed positioning. <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/demo/css-fixed-position.php">Here</a> is a great example of it at work.

    Of course there are more complicated aspects to all of these position attributes, but I hope this quick and simple guide was enough to help you understand the basic differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning. </p>
