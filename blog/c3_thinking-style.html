    <h2>My Thinking Style</h2>

    <p>
      According to the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a>, I am an Abstract Random Thinker. I would agree to a certain point - of course, no one always fits completely into just one category - but I feel I have a lot of attributes from the other thinking styles as well. <br><br>

      For example, for the abstract random thinker, they like to listen to others and establish healthy relationships, which I do. But I also like to take risks and solve problems independently (concrete random). And I actually do not like being given broad or general guidelines or participating in group activities and much prefer having access to experts/references and being able to work alone (abstract sequential). <br><br>

      Reflecting back on my Phase 0 experience so far, I'd say the biggest struggle has been when I couldn't figure out a solution to a problem by myself. I generally like to solve things on my own and dislike relying on others, but in the DBC environment I've had to let go of that mindset and not be afraid to ask questions. I don't think this is really related to the way I think though, but more because I'm a very introverted person. However, I know that DBC offers countless resources and the support environment is spectacular, so I know that I need to take advantage of that and allow myself to work with others.

    <p>
      I like to think I have more of a growth mindset than a fixed one. Generally, I am very open-minded and welcome ideas, and enjoy learning new things. However, I know that I also fear change, and that can hinder the way I learn and think. But I find that as long as I believe in myself and want to be a better, more well-rounded person, I am willing to push the boundaries of my comfort zone to expand my horizons and thus make it easier for me to learn quickly and effectively. I'm constantly striving to be the best I can be, and being around other super-motivated, inspiring people only helps to help me grow.
