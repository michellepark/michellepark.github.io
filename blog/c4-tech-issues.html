    <h2>Lack of Women in the Tech World</h2>

    <p>As many are unsurprised to know, the tech industry is dominated with men. It has always been, and remains that way today. Women make up only one-fourth of the tech industry workforce, and with the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicting that by 2020 there will be 1.4 million computer-science related jobs available in the US, that trend will continue in the future unless we do something about it.</p>

    <p>Here are some background stats you may want to know:</p>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Women made up 26% of the computing workforce in 2013.</li><br>

        <li>In the mid-1980s, 37% of CS majors were women; in 2012 it was just 18%</li><br>

        <li>20% of software developers are women</li> <br>

        <li>Professional women earn 73 cents to the dollar compared to their male coutnerparts</li>

          <ul><li>That can add up to $17,000+ a year! Women are also shown to ask for less money than men.</li></ul><br>

        <li>7% of venture capital funding goes to women-owned businesses</li>

        <ul><li>Even with the exact same pitch, the average person chose the man over the woman.</li></ul><br>

        <li>56% of women in tech leave their employers midcareer</li>

      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>But it's not all doom and gloom: here are the rays of hope emerging and hopefully staying:</p>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Women are the lead adopters of technology</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Women in western countries use the internet 17% more than their male counterparts</li>
            <li>They also use their mobile phones, location-based services, and social media sites more, and are the majority of owners of tech devides</li>
          </ul> <br>
        <li>Startups with women executives succeed more often</li>
          <ul><li>Can I just get a "f*** yeah!"" here?! Who's with me??</li></ul> <br>
        <li>More women than men enrolled in intro to computer science at Berkeley for the first time</li>
          <ul><li>Also, another whoo-hoo! for my alma mater!</li></ul> <br>
        <li>Young girls are now showing interest in computer science</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>Not only do women face an unwelcoming environment when it comes to the tech world, they are often saddled with sexual harrassment and lack of support, among other things. It's no wonder, because little girls are taught to like Barbies and rainbows while gadgets and technology are for boys. In this world of gender stereotypes, it's hard for women to come out of their role as "I'm supposed to be teacher and leave the hard stuff for men".</p>

    <p>The way to combat this is to go back to the roots. Encourage little girls to get into science and technology (that it's ok to be "geeky" while also playing with Easy Bake Ovens) at a young age. Encourage them to take technology-related courses in school. Encourage them to code because that's bad-ass.</p>

    <p id="footer">Companies like Google are helping to tackle this issue by investing millions of dollars in campaigns to help females get more interested in STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering, and Math). But it starts with us: by not perpetuating/supporting this preconceived notion that the tech world is for men, and motivating girls of all ages to pursue a career in this discipline, we can empower each other along the journey to greatness.</p>
