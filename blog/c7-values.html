    <h1>Values</h1>

    <p>When I think about the times in my life when I've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, the main values that come to mind are: accomplishment, confidence, excellence, excitement, friendships, growth, inspiration, integrity, knowledge, and truth</p>

    <p>There are many values which I, well, value, and it's hard to just pick one or two or even a few that are the most important, because I feel that a lot go hand-in-hand. But if I had to choose one to talk about, I'd say it's integrity.</p>

    <p>I feel integrity is so multifacted: it encompasses so many of the other virtues that I hold highly. Without integrity, we are nothing. Integrity not only makes us who we are, but also pushes us to be the best we can be, to help others be the best, and to do the right thing, even when no one is watching.</p>

    <p>In general I try to live up to all of the aforementioned values to the best of my abilities. Of course, it's hard to always be the best at all times, and sometimes I do slip and will fall out of integrity. But the person I disappoint the most is myself, because if I can't be in integrity, how can I expect other people to be?</p>

    <p>When I think about my values, I feel like I can always strive to be a better person. Not to say that I'm bad now, but no one's perfect and there's always room for improvement.</p>

    <p>I feel like having all these values can help me mediate stereotype threat if I recognized it because I know how to be true to myself and that I'd be falling out of integrity if I didn't try to do something about it. What kind of person would I be if I allowed such negativity to impact the way I live my life?</p>

    <p id="footer">I am positive that DBC will be full of other thoughtful, open-minded, righteous people who will be there for me and for each other. But I also know that there will be times when things will get to be too much and be too stressful in such a competitive environment. In times like those, I hope to be able to just take a step back and look at myself from an outside point of view and tell myself that it's OK to have bad days, that even the best of us have not-so-good values, but those are not the moments that define us. The moments that define us are <em>how</em> we choose to deal with these problems, and to persevere in the face of darkness. And with such a great support system, how hard can that be? I hope: not at all. :)</p>
