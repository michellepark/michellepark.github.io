    <h1>Asking Good Questions</h1>

    <p>We've all been there. Having a million questions and afraid of asking any in fear that it's stupid. And people always tell you "there's no such thing as a stupid question." But the question is, how do you ask a good question?</p>

    <p>First of all, know what you're trying to ask. If you can't make sense of the question, chances are other people won't as well. Try and research the question and keep track of the answers you find. Just the process of searching for an answer can lead you one step closer to the answer itself.</p>

    <p>Another tip in asking a good question is being concise. If your question is too long or doesn't make sense, then how will other people be expected to answer it? A good way to think about it is this: pretend you're talking to a busy colleague and have to sum up your question in one sentence. What key information would you put in and what unnecessary details would you keep out?</p>

    <p>And this might seem obvious, but grammar, spelling, and punctuation count!! Again, it's all about being clear and concise.</p>

    <p>Here are a couple examples of good vs. bad questions:</p>

    <p><ul>
        <li><b>Bad:</b> looping confusion</li>
        <li><b>Good:</b>What is the difference between a for and each loop?</li> <br>
        <li><b>Bad:</b> git commit help</li>
        <li><b>Good:</b> How do I commit from the working directory on the command line using git?</li>
       </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Another point when asking good questions is to be specific. Include exactly what is causing the problem (if any), all relevant source code, and how you encountered it. Don't be afraid of asking for help!</p>

    <p>But even if you ask good questions, sometimes they won't always get answered. I know I've posted a question on the Google+ community that didn't help me the way I wanted. Granted, I don't think that was due to my framing of the questions or lack of care on other people's parts. In my case, it was more of that the answer I got didn't clarify enough for me that I asked a follow-up question, which never got answered. But I feel that was just because it was in a hard to see place and no one really saw it. I did end up figuring it out though, so all's well that ends well :) </p>

    <p id="footer">I'm the type who greatly prefers trying to figure out something on my own before asking someone else, so in that sense I feel like the questions I do end up asking will be well-thought out and researched. The most important thing to remember is not to give up and make the <i>process</i> of asking a question just as important - if not more - as the answer itself. Then let the knowledge flow!</p>
