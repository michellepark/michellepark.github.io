    <h1>Conflict and the Compass of Shame</h2>


    <p><img class="pix" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michellepark/michellepark.github.io/master/blog/blog-imgs/compass-of-shame.png"></p>

    <p>Ah, the ever disgraceful compass of shame. I'm sure we've all been there once or many a time (if not, who are you and can you be my friend, you magical unicorn??). There are always going to be conflict in our lives, whether it be big or small, and how we choose to deal with it is going to shape who we are.</p>

    <p>I know I've had many conflicts in the past. Most of them come from romantic relationships, which makes sense because you make yourself the most vulnerable in these types of relationships and there're so many emotions at stake. And for me personally, I tend to go back and forth between the north and south directions of the compass.</p>

    <p>I remember having a serious conversation about something with my partner, and I knew that we needed to talk about it and come up with a solution. Yet even though I consider myself a pretty sensible person, there was a part of me that somehow felt like if I just didn't think about it or kept pushing it off, then the problem would at least be avoided for another day, another time, and thus not be a problem anymore. At the same time, I would withdraw and isolate myself so that I wouldn't have to deal with it. So basically I was in denial, and trying to hide from the fact that I was in denial.</p>

    <p>Eventually though, it got to the point where not doing anything about it was signaling the end of the road. So I had to face my fears and my problems and address them head-on. And even though it was hard, talking through everything and letting our feelings be known was one of the best things I could've done. It didn't solve our problems, but it definitely made it better and was a step to recovery.</p>

    <p id="footer">I wish that I had addressed these problems when they first surfaced, instead of letting it get worse and worse. I now know that avoidance and withdrawal is not the solution to any problem. I can't change the past, but I can learn from it and prevent it from happening again. So even though I'll continue to make mistakes, I know I'll be ok as long as I don't make the same ones.</p>
