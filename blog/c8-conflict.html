    <h1>Conflict and the Compass of Shame</h2>

    ![compass-of-shame](blog-imgs/compass-of-shame.png)

    <p>Ah, the ever disgraceful compass of shame. I'm sure we've all been there once or many a time (if not, who are you and can you be my friend, you magical unicorn??). There are always going to be conflict in our lives, whether it be big or small, and how we choose to deal with it is going to shape who we are.</p>

    <p>I know I've had many conflicts in the past. </p>

    Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?
    What was the source of the conflict?
    How did you handle that conflict?
    Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?
    If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
    What did you learn from this experience?
