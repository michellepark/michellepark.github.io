    <h2>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h2>

    <h3>Pairing</h3>

    <p>When I found out that pairing was an essential component to DBC and to becoming a programmer, I'm not gonna lie, I was dreading it big time. I had this preconceived notion that it would just be a hassle and wouldn't be that beneficial. Boy was I wrong.</p>

    <p>I realized that I actually really enjoy pairing. It gives me a greater sense of where I stand, not only on a technical level, but a cultural one as well. I found that I felt inspired and motivated by almost everyone that I've paired with, and that feeling is invaluable. Also, a lot of them are more advanced then me in terms of programming, and fortunately were always willing to help me when I had questions, so that was a great learning experience. The rewarding feeling of accomplishing a challenge together is a great confidence booster.</p>

    <p>The downside to pairing is when we both get frustrated and stuck on something we just can't seem to figure out. I remember this was most prominent in the CSS blog challenge, because CSS itself can just be a hassle to work with, but not having a lot of experience with it and trying to build a website was quite the defeating experience. In that moment it's hard to enjoy pairing, but there will always be bad sides that come along with the good.</p>

    <h3>Feedback</h3>

    <p>I also thought feedback was an unnecessary component to programming, but I was proven wrong again. I didn't think I'd be affected by reading my feedback, but I actually was, much to my surprise. There were the ones that made me feel good, like I knew what I was doing and a great partner, and then there were ones that gave me great constructive criticism. I hadn't even noticed some of these things that were pointed out, so I'm glad they were so I can work on them and be more aware in future pairing sessions.</p>

    <p>Writing feedback is sometimes difficult to do, only because of the specificity involved. I don't want to just provide the general "you were a great partner, keep up the good work", but sometimes things do go really well and there's nothing much to say in terms of giving actionable feedback. But I think this is a great exercise in having to think beyond normal bounds and actually write something that will benefit others.</p>

    <p id="footer">Overall, I really like that pairing and feedback are included in the DBC curriculum. It helps me grow as a person and as a programmer, and is one of the main reasons I've learned so much so far. I hope it only gets better from here on out, and am looking forward to pairing more in the future.</p>
