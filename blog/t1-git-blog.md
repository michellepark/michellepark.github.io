<!-- This template is in markdown, not html, so
  it will not render beautifully when you copy and
  paste it into your github.io site, but it will at
  least be published. Next week you'll be creating a
  blog template using HTML and CSS and you'll be able
  to copy and paste the blog posts from week 1 in there
  to make them pretty next week.

  For now, please replace the title, subtitle (if desired),
  and date with the text you would like. Markdown is pretty
  simple, so you can just feel free to type. =) -->

- What are the benefits of version control?

Version control keeps track of the all the changes you make to a file and saves it along the way. Think of it like a "checkpoint" in a video game. If you die, mess up, or just wanna play that section again, you can revert back to this checkpoint and start from there instead of from the very beginning. Version control works the same way. This is great in case something goes wrong, like your program gets a bug. Instead of having to redo possibly hundreds of hours of work, you can just go back to your last saved point and work again from there.

- How does git help you keep track of changes?

Git is just a type of version control system that you install on your computer to help you manage your changes. It is designed such that it views your code files like a “tree” and allows you to do things like create a “branch” where you work on some of the files without affecting the “trunk” code base. 

- Why use GitHub to store your code?

Github is a website that allows you to store your code. One of the best features of GitHub is that it is an excellent collaboration tool for developers to work together on a project. It allows access control and remote access, so anyone can access code on Github from anywhere in the world. Users can copy/upload/change code without altering the original version, and this is a great way for people to contribute/teach/learn and build amazing things together.
