<!-- This template is in markdown, not html, so
  it will not render beautifully when you copy and
  paste it into your github.io site, but it will at
  least be published. Next week you'll be creating a
  blog template using HTML and CSS and you'll be able
  to copy and paste the blog posts from week 1 in there
  to make them pretty next week.

  For now, please replace the title, subtitle (if desired),
  and date with the text you would like. Markdown is pretty
  simple, so you can just feel free to type. =) -->


# Cultural Blog: Chefs in the Kitchen
# 9.18.14

DBC seems to me like not only is it an educational experience/institution, it is a cultural one. It fosters an environment where people from all over the world with all kinds of different backgrounds can come together and bond over similar passions, goals, and ideas. I feel like I'd gain more than just technical knowledge - I'll gain friends (maybe enemies, but hopefully not), self-awareness, tools to help me be a better, more well-rounded person. I see myself trying to take advantage of everything DBC has to offer, and it’s slightly frightening thinking about being overwhelmed with all there is to do. But it’s also exciting to know that I’ll come out ahead, both in skills and as an individual. I am ready to be surrounded by other people who are eager to learn and who will motivate me to succeed, and am looking forward to this experience. :)
